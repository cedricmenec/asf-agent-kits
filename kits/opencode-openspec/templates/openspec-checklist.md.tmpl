# OpenSpec checklist contract (ported from ThreadStep ASF-OPSX-01/02)

The implementation checklist in tasks.md contains checkboxes only for code changes
and deterministic checks possible during apply BEFORE OPSX semantic sync, archive
and publication. Keep observable GIVEN/WHEN/THEN scenarios in the delta specs,
not mixed into executable tasks when they require visual or human acceptance.
Report unresolved requirements without inventing decisions or marking tasks complete.

Put actual browser/touch/keyboard/visual/human acceptance in a separate
`Manual acceptance` section WITHOUT checkboxes. Put semantic post-sync comparison,
archive, independent GitHub PR CI and merge review in `Post-sync review`
WITHOUT checkboxes. Neither section is evidence that human checks occurred.

Bad mixed checkbox (the subjective Verify clause is not executable during apply):

```md
- [ ] Implement a status selector and unit tests. Verify: GIVEN it renders, WHEN a user observes it, THEN the selected option is visually distinguishable.
```

Good separation:

```md
## Implementation checklist
- [ ] Implement the status selector with aria-pressed and deterministic tests.

## Manual acceptance
- GIVEN the selector renders, WHEN a user observes it, THEN the active option is visually distinguishable.

## Post-sync review
- Independently review the semantic sync and PR CI after publication.
```

Descriptions such as "visually hidden label" or "manual mode" and automated
Playwright assertions in a real browser are allowed in implementation checkboxes
when they are deterministic. A human/real-device acceptance is not. Before ending plan, inspect tasks.md for
mixed verification clauses and move them into the non-checkbox review sections.

During apply, fix test failures in the same authorized model invocation when
possible, rerun target checks and mark [x] only for completed and verified work.
If a forbidden file or unresolved requirement blocks progress, stop and report.
Never launch another paid invocation or retry automatically.
